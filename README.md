# Ironbelchers

This Project aims to teach young people thir first steps in Java 
Ironbelchers is a simple game where two players each control a ship in real time.
The players have to maneuver their vessels around islands and shoot their enemy with
their weapon.

Players will get bored with this game rather quickly, and thats ok!
Once that happens, we encourage them to use the ingame weapon creator to make and 
compile their own weapons during runtime.

Once they have a good feel for how the game is supposed to work, they can begin to 
make their own changes to the gamefiles.

Currently this prototype version needs to be started with gradle run. In the future, it should be 
possible to normally compile the java classes by console, so that the project can be edited without
an IDE

Rules: First a player needs to select their weapon. Unless they created their own weapons, there
will be only one available at the start. Each player controls a ship. 
A player wins the game by sinking the other ship with several hits
or if the other player destroys their own ship by steering it into an island.

# Controls:

Steer with WASD
Fire with Spacebaar

Player 2:
